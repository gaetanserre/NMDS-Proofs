### NMDS Proofs

Proofs in Lean of several results on the asymptotic convergence of [SVGD](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2016/file/b3ba8f1bee1238a2f37603d90b58898d-Paper.pdf). It is associated with the algorithm NMDS.

#### Usage
- Install Lean. See instruction [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html);
- Clone the repo;
- Run `lake exe cache get` in the root directory of the repo to download mathlib;
- Visualize the proofs using the extension for Emacs or Visual Studio Code.
